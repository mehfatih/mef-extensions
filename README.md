Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) Extensions

#Problem
MEF does not allow you to remove plugins(dll files) while the process is running. The reason is that the process use dll while it is running and operating system does not allow you to remove these files. Consequently, you can not remove plugins, you can add only.

#Solution
This project is designed to manage plugings(extensions) with yml file.
